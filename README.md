# Terminal-thingy
So what was i supposed to do here....

*oh yeah.* This program is just me practicing my python skills. And as you can tell my code ***sucks*** :/
But hey, at least i get a cool bar showing that this code is 100% python :)


## WARNING‼‼

You probably want to use the stable branch over main. main is more experimental and while it once have any consequences, the bugs might be annoying, ESPECIALLY if i accidently hit push on VSC so yeah, might wanna use this branch.
