# Terminal-thingy
_What was i meant to do again?_


This program is just me practicing my python skills. And as you can tell my code ***sucks*** :/
But hey, at least i get a cool bar showing that this code is 100% python :)

### Caution: 
You probably want to use the stable branch over main. main is more experimental and while it once have any consequences, the bugs might be annoying, **ESPECIALLY** if i accidently hit push on VSC so yeah, might wanna use stable.

Also noting that this code is not finished in even the slightest. When it's finished, there will be an actual terminal instead of you running it from your terminal.
